Valivali,Female,28,Ramoji Film City,"I visited film city on 01-04-2021. It was excellent. Best Place to visit in Hyderabad. Best for Families, Friends, Couples, Children's and for every one. Best in hospitality. Best Cooperative Employees. Best Guides. Comfortable, Clean & Neat every place including washrooms. Foot-by-Foot water facilities with cool and disposable glass also. Infact one day was not enough to enjoy the entire film city, minimum 02 days. Guidance and Hospitality towards us was very much appreciable. We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature. After some phone calls and messages, i got my bag via courier and all things were as same as left bag(No things were missed nor disturbed yet). Finally i give 05 stars for film city and 1 star for Food Rate.",5
Muralidar,Male,24,Ramoji Film City,Family its come to plan emoji film city it's good plase and good food also new gardens and new children park and goodentertene ment iam very happy the company provide the ramoji film city enjoy the trip.,5
Simran,Female,28,Ramoji Film City,Your hyderabad trip is not complete if you don't make a visit to this place. As i am from hyderabad and all those who visit us for a holiday we make sure to take them to this place. This time it was my 8th visit to RFC. Wonderful experience as always. As this place is huge it take the entire day. Make sure to take rest the next day of the visit as it drains you.,5
Bhavesh Bhariya,Male,36,Ramoji Film City,"Terrible experience...
Started the journey early morning...7.30..very far isolated from main city. They don't allow any kind of food item... selling their food items in their stalls at very high rates....20 rupees item available at the rate of 80 rupees. Also all the items are fast food...so small children and elderly may suffer from hypoglycemia...no healthy choices available...
It's only money making business... ticket rates are already very high...the difference between adult and children rate only 200rupees...not in capacity to visit the tour by middle class...who have earned the money by hard work...
No resting place with shadow at some points...can not visit again...
After visiting the place you are the most tired person...",1

Amit Khare,Male,35,Ramoji Film City,"Do’s
1. Reach early.
2. Take a bus tour at the earliest to first know the place and then prioritize the locations.
3. Prioritize as per own choice.
4. Carry water.
Don’ts
1. Waste time in initial photography as there are many places to click pics.
2. Don’t wait for kids rides till the end as the crowd increases towards later half.",4
Anurag,Male,42,Ramoji Film City,"Certainly over rated place. I do not have any idea how to go in personal vehicle.

No trees, no shelter on top forced to go by bus.

food quality is very bad.

I will never go again.",1

Grand welcome is really good.

Desi Ghumakkad,Male,38,Ramoji Film City,I went there with my wife & friends. It is situated nearby to Hyderabad Airport. I just loved the place. I saw so many sets of different films. It took complete one day to go through each and every part of Ramoji Film City. It's a complete one day picnic. I have enjoyed throughly.,5
Twinkle Sonar,Female,26,Ramoji Film City,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in HyHad a great time here. Indian Universal Studio. Everything is nice here. Food, tour guide, location and activities inside.",4
Surendra,Male,28,Ramoji Film City,"Over all it is okay, but not really worth the hype. Though it attracts visitors from all over the country, ignoring local language is really worrying. Guides are using Hind and English only and not Telugu.

Had dinner at Tara restaurant and not at all up to the standards of a 3 star hotel.",3
scvrose,Male,41,Ramoji Film City,"The largest film lot in the world, according to Guiness records, the studios cover over 1600 acres and has 47 sound studios. The park is pretty hokey, more for kids, and people who like Bollywood sets. It was Greek to me, and I was from Hollywood.",3
Sumitrasrivatsava,Female,29,Ramoji Film City,"The challenge is that all shows are mediocre quality. The Aladdin in animations do not really look real by international standards today. So is the Wild West Stunt show. Needs a lot of work to capture imagination. Busses too are a problem, some are non branded as well and old. The whole idea is to sell food and merchandise rather than focus on making this a great imaginative content truely first class. Crowd management and orderly information is a challenge. Still the best way to enjoy this is to come in the afternoon when the most of the crowd had already tired. I wish they allow the ticket to be usable for two days so before I get tired, I exit and come back again the following day. With today's technology, it will not be a problem managing that noone sees the same show twice.",3
Surabji S,Female,34,Ramoji Film City,"This is a huge film city , with two guided tour, studio tour and bahubali / eco tour. But this is not very planned w.r.t to old people , young couples with kids. Extremely exhausted and also not friendly for people in wheel chairs. Staff is good in speaking but can't help you much very process driven as where bus will drop and pick.",3
Ambrish L,Male,43,Ramoji Film City,"Attempt1: I tried reaching the airport counter for help on reaching the Ramoji film city, the guy was chatting with someone on phone, He didn't even want to help. He gave me the pamphlet and said all details are available here call the toll free.
Attempt2: I called the toll free, I wanted to know what's the nearby point from my hotel where i can catch the bus to Ramoji. We didn't know which stop to goto as i was a tourist to hyd, I explained the same to her. She didn't have any idea of helping, she said ""refer the website"" and disconnected the line after 20 mins of waiting.

Attempt3: We took a full day cab and shelled out 2k , then paid 2.7 k for entrance (for two).

The park was good, well maintained and spread out. The bahubali set was the best. Sometimes we felt they forced ppl to see everything like seeing the butterfly garden and bird santury while we wanted to get to the bus.",2
Kumar P,Male,42,Ramoji Film City,"A completely average experience. Exorbitantly priced. not at all worth Rs 1300/-.
no proper management to guide visitors. pathetic food options. you are forced to eat whatever 2-3 limited options they have. you get only chips and water and paper boat. no proper food options. too much hype which does not meet the expectations. we almost got caught in a stampede because everyone runs in the direction of the crowd since there is no proper crowd management.",3
Kalpesh Shah,Male,35,Ramoji Film City,"If u have been to universal studio or disney world or anything in abroad, then its not for you. Else you will enjoy. Nice one day trip",3
Maresa G,Female,28,Ramoji Film City,"This is a worthwhile 1 hr roadtrip from the city Centre if you're 1. A big Bollywood fan or 2. You're a child.
I am a Bollywood fan but not a fanatic, and found this tour to be worthwhile and quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hyderbadh.
I enjoyed the fact that there is a lot more to do than merely tour a film studio. Mr Ramoji Rao clearly is an entrepreneur who knows how to bring in the crowds, and this can be a most enjoyable trip for a family with young kids, with the very attractive amusement park, Eureka and Fundustan; the Ramoji Movie Magic section with its Filmmaking experience, Eyelusion Gallery, Black Light show, Stunt show; as well as a bird park and butterfly garden, and a Japanese and bonsai garden, being just a few of the numerous immaculate gardens dotted around the grounds.
We visited now during the last week of the ""Longest Winter Fest"", which ran from 13 Dec and which will end on 26 Jan; hence the visiting crowds reasonably large, but clearly thinning out at this time, hence thankfully not having to queue for tickets.
The bus tours offered between 10am - 5pm are very well organized, allowing one to cover the grounds of the entire film city in pretty much 4 - 5 hours.
I thought this was more than enough time, but was rather disappointed that the tour guides only spoke in Hindi, and there was no attempt at all to accommodate us foreigners.
Should you want to experience this park fully, one can book a night at one of Ramoji's hotels and then have more than enough time to experience the various carnival shows and dance performances which take place after the park has closed.
No doubt, there is a lot to see, do and experience at Ramoji's Wonderland for anyone; whether you're a Bollywood fan, a local tourist, a child, or merely just a foreigner wanting to see how Ramoji the Magician transformed 1666 Ha of land into the World's Largest Film City!",4
Suman,Male,42,Golkonda Fort,We family visited at Golconda for weekday trip was enjoyed a lot and it's very far from main gate to reach top.if they provide any vehicle to show around would prefer for family.anyhow must see place,5
Deepyayan Ghosh,Male,25,Golkonda Fort,Golconda Fort is a ok place to visit but if you drop this place from your Hyderabad trip then it won’t be a loss.,3
Ardhanareshwara,Male,32,Golkonda Fort,"The Golkonda Fort looms over the modern city of Hyderabad in Telangana where it has stood since the 15thcentury. Built on a hill it is a fortified citadel which passed through several hands before the Qutub Shahi dynasty was established.
The nearby diamond mines produced the fabled Koh-I-Noor diamond now among the Crown Jewels in the U.K. with several other renowned ones.
A massive granite fortification extends around 5km in circumference. The fort later fell into ruin and taken over by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century.
The Fort continues to impress with its Victory Gate, Main Entrance Gate and the Durbar Hall and the Baramati atop the hill. There is a Mosque of Ibrahim also there.The structure is in fairly good state of repair and the various tombs,Gardens, rooms and tanks are worthy of spending a 2-3 hours visit.
The Golkonda Fort is popular with tourists and the local people alike. it is recommended that the tour is commenced as soon as the fort is open at 10 a.m. to beat the rush (esp at weekends) and the heat.There are plenty of photo opportunities so do not be in a rush.",5
Mahi Mulki,Male,28,Golkonda Fort,"Golkonda fort is very nice place to visit.
Entry fee is 25Rs and you can roam around the nuke and corner of fort. Best time to visit is morning and evening.
On top of the fort you can see one Temple and Darga. I don’t want to say much, just visit and enjoy if you like forts",5
Vakka manka,Female,36,Golkonda Fort,i saw how the people lived in those days very happily with nature without electricity or any other present facilities.,4
Mihir D,Male,40,Golkonda Fort,"Excellent place with Pathetic Post Covid preparation, Security there in the main gate is illiterate & they don't even know what to check & how to check... They are even don't know Mobiles are allowed inside since the beginning. Very poor preparation of Covid.... Security allowing all the people at a time even without mask & seen security sleeping inside the park. Also security is having alliance with the PAN shop there to keep people belongings by taking money.... Pathetic experience with the management & even seen staffs not wearing any mask & no phone no is working for Archaeological survey of India to give our feedback.. But this was pathetic...",1
Nipunika J,Female,35,Golkonda Fort,"Visited it in late afternoon in December hence was pretty hot. It was pretty crowded, the fort is interesting place. Worth a visit when in Hyderabad. The roads around are narrow, hence plan your visit likewise if driving there.",3
Oneil,Male,42,Golkonda Fort,"This is one of the places worth visiting when in Hyderabad. It has been maintained & kept fairly clean & enforced by their vigilant security staff. The only short-coming is the rates fixed by the guides there. INR 1250 charged by them is a little excessive.
Electronic audio guides need to be installed by the Government/Management at the earliest.",4
Lyn V,Male,50,Golkonda Fort,We really enjoyed the history of this ancient fortress. We went on a very warm day so take water with you. Love the old ruins and architecture and how they built into rocks and surrounds. Try to get to the top for the view and photos. Still in great condition for a fortress from the 12th century!,4
Sunder S,Male,32,Golkonda Fort,"This was a huge let-down. The fort is a crumbling ruin, poorly maintained. All that has been done is to create a lawn-like space in the front. The rest of the fort is left as it is - overgrown weeds/plants, run-down look, and a general sense of decay. This could have been developed into something worthwhile - a pity! India has too many of these forts for us to bother about maintenance. Perhaps if the ASI could hand over these monuments to the local state government it would be better off.

The tour guides simply try to rip you off - they start with a price of Rs. 1200, and what you pay is your skill to negotiate. We paid Rs. 800 for the long tour. Why can't the ASI also publish the tour guide prices like they do in other places?",2
Ken W,Male,38,Golkonda Fort,"We came in the evening to watch the sound and light show. It’s about a 4 hundred metre walk from the entrance to where the seats are located.

There are 2 sets of seats...vip on a raised area up some steps, and ordinary at ground level. To be honest, I think the view was probably as good from the non-vip seats. Bottom line, there’s not a lot of difference.

They do give out tubes of insect repellent, but we had applied our own spray before arriving. There are plenty of mosquitoes, but we weren’t bitten.

The sound and light show was ok, but there were many songs and poems included in the performance, which meant that the whole thing dragged on quite a bit. We’d previously been to a similar show in Jaipur and Udaipur which were superior. However, if we hadn’t been to the other shows, we probably would’ve enjoyed this one more.

Overall, it was worth going but we won’t return.",3
James L,Male,26,Golkonda Fort,"It's quite a climb to the top, but worth it! My guide Nagarjuna from Asli Hyderbad took me here, and had great knowledge about all the history. Also kept me safe from all the people asking to be my guide!",5
Nilesh Patil,Male,28,Golkonda Fort,"Good.
Laser show was good. Hugh area.
Well maintained.....
Lot of mosquitoes in the evening during laser show.......
.....",4
Moogul818,Male,41,Golkonda Fort,"Golconda Fort Hyderabad is a marvelous historical structure. Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.

The Golconda Fort has visit timings and entry fee including a separate fee for the light and sound show. Therefore you will need to plan your visit carefully, if you would like to see the light and sound show also. If there in the evening catch the sunset from the top of the fort. A good place to see during your visit to Hyderabad.",4
Ashu,Female,25,Golkonda Fort,"We visited with family in Dec 2019. This place is highly maintained. Very nice. Guide is also easily available and are very knowledgeable.
The only problem is parking space. Not enough space for parking.
Evening light show is awesome.
Beware of mosquitos.",4
Avinash Reddy,Male,29,Golkonda Fort,"Great place with amazing views of Hyderabad city. Lot of historical values are connected with this fort. Clean, easy connectivity, visiting hours from 8.30am to 5pm. Just one problem need to carry your own water as it is not available inside the fort and the peak of the fort is 1km hike. So carry your water and most importantly DO NOT LITTER.",3
Karthik I,Mae,43,Golkonda Fort,"It is technically a place only for history, no proper facilities or cleanliness at the place. Full exploitation by vendors there. Not at all properly maintained place.",2
Biju,Male,26,Golkonda Fort,"For a monument of such important, kept extremely dirty, the place is treated like an open trash can.
-Staff seems not interested in maintaining it.
- I felt very sad that such an important monument is left to rot ..",2
KevanEastYorkshire,Male,27,Golkonda Fort,Really enjoyed our tour of the fort. Its abig place and on ahot morning there are so many steps to climb. we enjoyed being guided. much of what is left is aruin so interpretation is required. Great to interact with the indian tourists and scholl parties allwanting to talk and take phots with you.,5
Saarah B,Female,45,Golkonda Fort,The fort is very marvelously built and the structure is one worth seeing. The fort is huge and it’s awe inspiring that such a beautiful construction was made in times where there were no machines and nothing to help people make the fort. The sunsets at Golconda Fort are ravishing. Will recommend going here if you have come to Hyderabad.,4
Charles Dulles,Male,39,Taj Falaknuma Palace,We had the hi tea here. Transported to the days of Nizams! The spread was amazing and service was excellent. Expensive but worth it.,5
Barbara A,Female,19,Taj Falaknuma Palace,This has been my best hotel experience ever. The staff is wonderful and would help in diet needs or anything needed in room or to make a comfortable. stay. The food was great and so was the spa,5
Neeraja V,Female,28,Taj Falaknuma Palace,Enjoyed the most amazing view of Hyderabad from the ‘Jade Room’ with twinkling stars in the Sky touching the ground. Soulful music of live Sufi songs makes the place reminisce the days of Nizam. The historical tour of the palace is enlightening along with an sumptuous meal of different courses.The staff are warm and helpful. The Grandeur and ambience of the palace is perfect for special occasions.,4
Iain C ,Male,31,Taj Falaknuma Palace,If ever you get the chance to stay here do. It is a wonderful hotel and not to be missed. Everything is first class if not better and the staff and food are extraordinary.,5
Swarangsu,Male,27,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"We went to Taj Faluknama for lunch + palace tour. You definitely get the royal treatment from horse carriage rides to floral showers to impressive cutlery. We had lunch at Adda which was a set menu buffet. The kebabs were simply out of the world. The rest of the spread was also good, but kebabs were the highlights according to me. Post lunch we took the palace tour which was good but I dare say falls a bit short if you compare with similar palace tours in Rajasthan.
Overall definitely a very good experience. If you are going on your own, be prepared to shell out a sizeable amount. It is one of the most expensive place to go in Hyderabad. Also remember to book in advance",5
Pargaonkar,Male,39,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"The palace tour is a good to do once. It is a beautiful palace. If you are lucky you might even get a glimpse of some movie shooting from distace. Food is definitely good. Chef took care of my request for pregnancy friendly food. The food did taste good. Will I pay Rs.5000 for the food there..... hmmm, I will explore Jewels of Nizam first and then decide. :)",4
Ashwin Vemuri,Male,55,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"Ostentatiously Beautiful Palace Hotel, One of The Best In The World With All It's Princely Charm for Every Guest With An Amazing Bespoke Menu for The Upper Echelons.",5
ResortSeeker,Male,38,Taj Falaknuma Palace,Great place to spend the weekend. Interesting residence that is full of history. Just as some of the staff and they will tell you whatever you want to know about the house.,4
Vagish Dixit,Male,21,Taj Falaknuma Palace,Conceded that this is not a specially abled friendly place with no ramps and lifts in sight. But this is an old palace with the zillion steps from floor 0 to floor 1 and of course a horse carriage ride from main entrance to porch. Every room smells of history in its lush and princely aura. Service is genuinely reflective of the period and food is to die for. Overall this place is amazing and is a bucket list item for anyone visiting Hyderabad.,5
Indusman248,Male,27,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"Great arrival experience on a Royal Horse Cart (Bagi) from the Palace entrance gate to the main porch - this was coupled with Rose petal shower as a romantic welcome to the Palace.

The palace tour takes about an hour and our Tour Guide was using plenty of Urdu couplets during the tour which made the entire experience interesting. There is a souvenir shop in the palace which needs an improvement from collection and its pricing perspective (collection is not that great and pricing is on the higher side).

Recommended not to take lunch before the High Tea as the choice is huge and one does not need to eat dinner post the High Tea. Price does not justify the overall experience - needs correction as found on the higher side.

This Palace is being managed by Taj Hotels and it was found that it is difficult to get connected with the associates of the Palace for booking",5
scvrose,Female,34,Taj Falaknuma Palace,The Taj sits on top of a hill overlooking Hyderabad in the background on one side plus the old fort. There is an interesting collection of antiques from the previous owners. Worth a visit. Also had high tea in the restaurant.,4
tapas1966205,Female,50,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"It was off course a small trip. However, right from picking us from the main entrance in the Tah Group Buggy/Golf cart till the High Tea, it was amazing. It is worth to mention the palace guide with an excellent sense of Poetry ( shayeri) . Zade room was awesome, one will remember the bathtub fitted in the queen's ( Begum?) bathroom and off course the 100 seater dining table. In fact description by words will be an injustice to the famed Falaknuma ( Like the Sky) Palace.",4
padmavathy66,Female,54,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"We went for evening High Tea.When we were ushered to the dining area I was for a shock.Such a tiny room and so much hype.our table was also very small .For 3 people they had to keep juggling the plates and the cake trays to accomodate all the items on the menu.
Even the tour of the palace was not satisfactory and lasted hardly 15 minutes as most of the area is used for commercial purpose .On that was there were few more private gatherings so all that areas which are originally in the touring list were out of bounds
We paid a Bomb for this and came back with a let down feeling",3
Bob A,Male,26,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"Regret to say the standard of this hotel has slipped since the last two previous visits we rated 5 Star.
The staff and opulence of this majestic palace have not changed (which is good) although the exterior of the palace is now looking tired and in need of renovation in many areas.
Where we were let down was with the food and in particular the Indian restaurant that one night served totally unsatisfactory biriyani mutton - complete disappointment as it was dry lacked spices and was served with a peanut sauce!!! Really !!! Peanut sauce with biriyani rice - I don’t think so
The breakfast buffet was also ordinary and many dishes served luke warm - not good enough this time around",3
Sangeetha R,Female,21,Taj Falaknuma Palace,Visiting and dining at Taj Falaknuma is indeed an unique experience. The palace tour is exhilarating and out of the world experience. Dining gives u spl feeling and royal. But the visits can be only few but can't be regular get away.,4
Alok B,Male,34,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"The place itself is unbeatable and great but it is too pricey and dining here has a ""MINIMUM SPENDING POLICY"" which is rubbish in my opinion.",3
Nid,Male,37,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"This is a really beautiful palace with architecture and decor influences from all over the world! If you're not staying at the hotel, you can go for the high tea and guided tour. The high tea itself is not that great, it's tea that comes with a bunch of snacks but the palace is worth it.",4
Susan w,Female,27,Taj Falaknuma Palace,The experience was brilliant. The tour of the palace was insightful but the food was not very special and was very expensive.,3
Anupama ,Female,36,Taj Falaknuma Palace,found the whole affair to be very expensive. only people with reservations for lunch tea or dinner can visit for a guided tour. and it was a minimum spend of 3000+taxes per person.,1
Male,heerpk,40,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"This may have been the most wonderful palace with exquisite interiors, but be warned of the minimum spend of a whopping INR 3500 per head (not inclusive of taxes), on just a visit to the property which is NOT mentioned clearly at the palace doors. Also, do note there is no way of redeeming the amount. I do agree they want to cater to classes, but they must SOUND THE SAME LOUD AND CLEAR! So a fab palace, which could burn a hole in your pocket unannounced.",1
Suman@620,Male,54,Charminar,It's nice to see hyderabad icon miner char miner.feel proud to be hyderabadi.those r in hyderabad Telangana starte must visit place,5
Amit Khare,Male,34,Charminar,It was too overcrowded even to have a look properly. We went in the evening time and there was not even space to stand. There was a problem of parking near the monument hence better to go by cab. The market is also too crowded to even take a look at goods properly.,2
Elizabeth L,Female,56,Charminar,"We had a BLAST! This was my last day in India and I was flying out of Hyderabad, so we came to Charminar the night before. For Americans, bargaining is not a thing - how fun it was and amazing deals we received on lots of jewelry items for me to take home to my friends and family. The actual Charminar architecture is breathtaking and is a must-see for anyone in the area.",5
Kasi,Male,34,Charminar,"Hyderabad in one of the most beautiful place charminar, here I like bangles and falls, daily here visiting more people's, when I visited charminar ,that guy told charminar history (superb)",5
Lalz,Male,43,Charminar,"The structure is iconic and is pretty much the face of Hyderabad but, is maintained horribly. I would strongly advise people not to go to the top. The staircase is extremely suffocating and cramped. No railing and once you go in, it's impossible to get out because there're people behind you. You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here. The marketplace isn't that well maintained either. I was born and brought up in this city and was really excited to visit the monument. Ruined everything for me.",1
Barbara A,Female,23,Charminar,This is in the middle of the old town with vendors all around. The charminar is impressive to look out and worth a walk to see it.,4

Purnimajaay,Female,31,Charminar,"The mosque is very beautiful. If you get to go in, then please do. Out of it will be local selling cheap stuffs. Don't get fooled by their pricing. Be alert and bargain well. Stay alert all time. Don't bring kids. Get ur stuff and walk away. Only buy if you want. If not just walk. It's risky but if possible go with any local.",2

Kaushik G,Male,54,Charminar,Charminar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. The place is very crowded with small vendors occupying the entire road outside the beautiful heritage structure. We enjoyed biscuits and tea at the nearby Nimrah Cafe and enjoyed the beauty of the Charminar right in front of us. One can go inside the Charminar up to a certain height and we saw many locals standing inside the Charminar.,4
Sunil,Male,37,Charminar,"The Charminar is very old and ancient.it looks gorgeous and lovely.
But the palce located is highly denced population and its too crowded and the place is not maintained well.",4
Greg48,Male,33,Charminar,"I first heard of the Charminar years ago by way of a cigarette brand which featured the structure on its packages.
The iconic symbol of Hyderabad dates back to the 1500's and is an interesting structure with 4 Minarets and 4 arches. The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for. Not being knowledgeable about jewelry I stayed with the costume jewelry and found the market to be enjoyable.

Lavanya S,Female,23,Sarath City Capital Mall,"I took my kids to Sarath City Mall after hearing great things about it. This review is largely about our experience in the 4th floor gaming area.

I am writing this review so that parents are cautious to look out themselves for their kids safety and to make management aware of how poorly trained the staff is. I work in customer service and it really baffled me why anyone would be paid money for such poor performance at work. This is what happened.

We reached the 4th floor gaming area at around 2 pm on a weekday. It was not crowded at all except for a large group of college kids in some college t shirts. I assumed they were there on some kind of college sponsored visit and didn't think much. The games asked for a card and I couldn't see where I could swipe my debit card. I looked around for staff but only saw the aforementioned college group chatting and playing some of the games. For the water ride, there wasn't even any staff managing it. I told my kids to stay and went walking around to see who could help us. I was shocked to find out that these 'college kids in uniform' were the staff!!

To me they had appeared like other customers. Two girls were sitting on some rides and even when we went and stood near them for our turn they did not get off. I asked one of them why aren't they helping us. I also asked to speak to a manager. The manager just apologized. After I expressed my disappointment and told him I would write a review was when a staff member came to help my kids. See second picture.

In an age when customer staff is competing with each other to win customers, I found this attitude shocking. Why aren't these kids trained? What are they getting paid for?

Except this experience, we really enjoyed the food in the food court and the exceptional service in all the other stores we went to. There is a good bouncy house too on the lower or first level that my kids liked.

Advice to families: Go for the rides and watch out yourself for your kids safety. Ask questions. Ensure your kids are safely buckled in. Don't expect to get any help from staff.

Kishore,Male,38,Sky Zone,No matter that our children had trampoline socks from another trampoline park - they were not the right colour and thereby unauthorised.
